# React E-Commerce Project

## Overview
This project is a React.js and Tailwind CSS practice project, aimed at building a dynamic and responsive e-commerce platform focused on gaming and Nintendo merchandise. The application offers users an intuitive interface to explore, search, and purchase products.

## Project Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- Created the React application and installed necessary dependencies.
- Linked the project to GitHub and created three branches for development: `main`, `development`, `feature-branches`.
- Managed and worked on each branch accordingly.

### 2. Folder Structure
- Created a `components` folder:
  - Includes components such as `Header`, `Footer`, and individual `Section` components (e.g., `Section1`, `Section2`, etc.).
- Created an `assets` folder:
  - Subdivided into `icons` and `images` folders.
  - Imported and exported images using a `.js` file for easy access.
- Added a `pages` folder:
  - Includes the `Shop` page where all components are integrated.
- Implemented a `notfound` folder:
  - Contains components to handle broken links and redirect to a "Not Found" page.

### 3. Styling
- Utilized Tailwind CSS for base styling and layout configurations.
- Customized styles using a `tailwind.config.js` file for more precise design control.
- Incorporated Font Awesome for icons and fonts.
- Added additional CSS styles for specific design elements to complement Tailwind CSS.

### 4. Routing
- Linked the `Shop` page to the main application using React Router.
- Utilized `Router` and `Routes` for navigation within the application.

### 5. Carousel Implementation
- Utilized the `.map()` function for rendering dynamic cards into carousel.
- Created a `.json` file to store product data.
- Dynamically rendered product cards using the data from the `.json` file.

### 6. Responsive Design
- Ensured a mobile-first approach for responsive design using Tailwind CSS utilities.
- Tested and optimized the application layout for various screen sizes.
